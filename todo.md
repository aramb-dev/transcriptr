# Transcriptr Audio Conversion Implementation TODO

## Project: Automated Audio Conversion for Transcription Service

### Overview

Implement CloudConvert integration to automatically convert unsupported audio formats (M4A, AAC, MP4, etc.) to MP3 before sending to Replicate for transcription.

---

## Phase 1: Setup and Configuration âœ…

- [x] CloudConvert API key acquisition (check if already in README)
- [x] Verify cloudconvert dependency is installed (already in package.json)
- [ ] Add CLOUDCONVERT_API_KEY to environment variables
- [ ] Update .env.local.example with new environment variable

---

## Phase 2: Backend Integration âœ…

- [x] Create new API endpoint `/src/app/api/convert/cloud/route.ts`
- [x] Implement CloudConvert job creation logic:
  - [x] Import file from URL
  - [x] Convert to MP3 format
  - [x] Export temporary URL
- [x] Add error handling for conversion failures
- [x] Add logging for debugging conversion process
- [x] Test CloudConvert integration (health check successful âœ… 2025-07-22)

  - [x] Examine current `src/components/transcription/FileUploadInput.tsx`
  - [x] Add logic to detect unsupported formats (.m4a, .aac, .mp4, etc.)
  - [x] Create utility function for format validation
- [x] **Conditional API Routing**:
  - [x] Modify upload flow to route to conversion endpoint for unsupported files
  - [x] Update existing transcription flow for supported files
- [x] **User Feedback States** (KEY CHANGE):
  - [x] Add "Converting audio file..." loading state
  - [x] Add progress indicators during conversion
  - [x] Transition to "Transcribing..." after conversion
  - [x] Handle conversion errors gracefully
  - [x] Updated TranscriptionStatus to include "converting" state

## Files to Modify/Create

### New Files:

- `src/app/api/convert/cloud/route.ts` - CloudConvert API endpoint
- `src/lib/cloudconvert-client.ts` - CloudConvert service wrapper
- `src/lib/file-format-utils.ts` - File format detection utilities

### Existing Files to Modify:

- `src/components/UploadAudio.tsx` - Add conversion flow
- `src/components/transcription/TranscriptionForm.tsx` - Integrate conversion
- `src/components/transcription/TranscriptionProcessing.tsx` - Update progress
- `src/components/transcription/FileUploadInput.tsx` - File type detection
- `src/components/UnsupportedFormatHelp.tsx` - Update messaging
- `src/components/Documentation.tsx` - Update docs
- `src/services/transcription.ts` - Add conversion types
- `README.md` - Update documentation

---

## Environment Variables Needed:

```bash
CLOUDCONVERT_API_KEY=your_cloudconvert_api_key_here
```

---

## Dependencies Status:

- âœ… `cloudconvert` - Already installed (v3.0.0)
- âœ… No additional dependencies needed

---

## Notes:

- CloudConvert supports conversion from most audio formats to MP3
- Current supported formats: MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG
- Target convertible formats: M4A, AAC, MP4, WMA, AIFF, CAF
- Show explicit conversion states to users (better UX for longer processing times)
- Need to handle conversion time in UI progress indicators with clear messaging

## Recent Fixes (2025-07-22)

### âœ… Issue 1: SSL Certificate Error in Replicate API

- **Problem**: `TypeError: fetch failed` with `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`
- **Fix**: Updated HTTPS agent configuration in `replicate-client.ts`
- **Status**: Resolved with `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` for development

### âœ… Issue 2: UI Not Showing Conversion State

- **Problem**: UI remained static during CloudConvert processing
- **Root Cause**: `isLoading` condition didn't include `"converting"` status
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Updated `isLoading` condition to include `"converting"` state
  - Updated `TranscriptionProcessing` component to handle converting status
  - Added immediate state callback with small delay to ensure UI updates
  - Updated file input to accept all supported formats (M4A, AAC, etc.)
- **Status**: UI now immediately shows "Converting..." state

### âœ… Issue 3: Converted Files Saved as URL Audio in History

- **Problem**: M4A files after CloudConvert conversion were saved as "URL audio" instead of file uploads
- **Root Cause**: Converted files passed only the CloudConvert URL, losing original file metadata
- **Fix**: Enhanced data flow to preserve original file information:
  - Updated `UploadAudio` interface to include `originalFile` metadata
  - Modified conversion flow to pass original file name and size
  - Updated `TranscriptionForm.handleUpload()` to detect converted files and save them as file uploads
- **Status**: Converted M4A files now appear in history with original filename, marked as file uploads

### âœ… Issue 4: API Response Logging for Conversion Transparency

- **Problem**: Users couldn't see what was happening during CloudConvert conversion process
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive API response logging throughout conversion flow:
  - Added `onApiResponse` callback to `UploadAudio` component interface
  - Enhanced conversion flow with detailed step-by-step logging:
    - Conversion start with file metadata
    - Firebase upload progress
    - CloudConvert API calls and responses
    - Job completion and success status
  - Connected logging to UI details panel via `TranscriptionForm`
- **Status**: All conversion steps now visible in UI details section with timestamps

### âœ… Issue 5: Transcription History Only Keeping Most Recent Entry

- **Problem**: Transcription history functionality was only retaining the most recent transcription, replacing previous entries instead of accumulating a chronological list
- **Root Cause**: `createSession()` function in `persistence-service.ts` was reusing the same session ID from cookies instead of creating unique IDs for each transcription
- **Fix**: Modified `createSession()` to always generate a new unique session ID:
  - Changed `const sessionId = getSessionId() || createSessionId();` to `const sessionId = createSessionId();`
  - This ensures each transcription gets its own database entry instead of overwriting previous ones
  - Session cookie tracking still works correctly for active session management
- **Status**: History now properly accumulates all transcriptions chronologically
